title: About Me

Hej, my name is Yannik

I'm a last year's student of cognitive computer science at [Bielefeld University](https://uni-bielefeld.de/), Germany and working student at [Wambo Agency](https://wambo-agency.com/).

My interests include Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as well as declerative programming languages and tools.

I maintain and contributed a few packages to the [NixOS package registry](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs). And am using the [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) package manager everywhere I can.

Curiously I follow the development of [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) since before its 1.0 release, and am eager to start a new project using it in the nearer future.

Lastly I enjoy diving into the hidden structures of society and existance.

I hope some of this blog might be of interest to someone even though I'll treat this more like a public notebook rather than a hardly dependable source of truth. 

You are still with me? Cool! Check out the menu to find out more about my recent projects, posts and if you are so inclined how to contact me!
